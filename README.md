nshogi is a comprehensive shogi library that allows you to manipulate game states, determine the next state from a given move and state, and generate all legal moves for a given state, and more.
Additionally, nshogi provides essential functionalities for machine learning, such as creating feature vectors for AlphaZero's neural network from a given state.

## Installation

### Requirements

- GNU Make
- g++ or clang++
- (optional) for Python module
  - python3
  - pybind11

### Build from source

#### C++ Library

Type `make [CXX=<CXX>] [<SSE INSTRUCTION>=1] [PREFIX=<PREFIX>] install` in your terminal, where:

- `<CXX>` is a C++ compiler.
- `<SSE INSTRUCTION>` is one of the {SSE, SSE41, SSE42, AVX, AVX2}, depends on the instructions your CPU supports.
- `<PREFIX>` is in which directory the library will be installed. The default value is `/usr/local`.

#### Python module

Type `make [CXX=<CXX>] [<SSE INSTRUCTION>=1] install-python` in your terminal, where:

- `<CXX>` is a C++ compiler.
- `<SSE INSTRUCTION>` is one of the {SSE, SSE41, SSE42, AVX, AVX2}, depends on the instructions your CPU supports.

### Run tests for the library

Type `make [CXX=<CXX>] [<SSE INSTRUCTION>=1] [PREFIX=<PREFIX>] runtest-{static|shared}` in your terminal, where:

- `<CXX>` is a C++ compiler.
- `<SSE INSTRUCTION>` is one of the {SSE, SSE41, SSE42, AVX, AVX2}, depends on the instructions your CPU supports.
- `<PREFIX>` is in which directory the library will be installed. The default value is `/usr/local`.
- runtest-static target will test the static library, and runtest-shared target will test the shared library.

### Examples with code

Under construction.
